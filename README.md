# movie_recommendation_system
This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System developed using Python and built in Google Colab. It suggests movies similar to a user-given title based on textual features like genre, keywords, and overview. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find and recommend the most relevant films.
